# Unity-Checkpoint-System-With-Sound
Unity Checkpoint System with Sound.
1) Add tag to your object. I choose the "Player" Tag.
2) Add an Audio Source code to empty GameObject. Put your sound to AudioClip parameter.
3) Create an Empty GameObject and add Checkpoint.cs code. This will be a parent of the checkpoints.
4) Create checkpoints and drag below the parent (which is you created at the 3rd stage.) Add them ChildCheckpoint.cs code.
